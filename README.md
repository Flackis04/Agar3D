# Three.js Vite Starter

This project uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and modern JavaScript support.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to the local server (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the 3D scene.

## Features
- Minimal three.js scene with a rotating cube
- Responsive canvas

## Project Structure
- `main.js`: Main entry point, sets up the three.js scene
- `index.html`: Loads the script and sets up the page

---

Feel free to modify the scene in `main.js` to experiment with three.js!
